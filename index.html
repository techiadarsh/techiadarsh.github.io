              Full of vexation come I, with complaint
              Against my child, my daughter Hermia.
              Stand forth, Demetrius. My noble lord,
              This man hath my consent to marry her.
              Stand forth, Lysander: and my gracious duke,
              This man hath bewitch'd the bosom of my child;
              Thou, thou, Lysander, thou hast given her rhymes,
              And interchanged love-tokens with my child:
              Thou hast by moonlight at her window sung,
              With feigning voice verses of feigning love,
              And stolen the impression of her fantasy
              With bracelets of thy hair, rings, gawds, conceits,
              Knacks, trifles, nosegays, sweetmeats, messengers
              Of strong prevailment in unharden'd youth:
              With cunning hast thou filch'd my daughter's heart,
              Turn'd her obedience, which is due to me,
              To stubborn harshness: and, my gracious duke,
              Be it so she; will not here before your grace
              Consent to marry with Demetrius,
              I beg the ancient privilege of Athens,
              As she is mine, I may dispose of her:
              Which shall be either to this gentleman
              Or to her death, according to our law
              Immediately provided in that case.
